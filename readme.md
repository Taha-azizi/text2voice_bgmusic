Description
This is a Python script that uses the Tortoise Text-to-Speech (TTS) model to generate high-quality voice overs. The script also supports adding optional background music to the output audio file. In the second file mini-notebooklm.py, I have added sections to generate podcast type of conversation, simulating something like the Famous NotebookLM. 

Requirements
Install the required libraries: pip install torchaudio pydub soundfile
Set the paths for FFmpeg's ffmpeg and ffprobe executables in the script if you encounter any issues with audio processing.
Usage
Place your background music file (MP3 format) in the same directory as this script.
Replace the background_music_path variable in the main function with the path to your music file.
Run the script: python src/main_image.py.
The voice-over will be saved as output_tortoise.wav, and if you provided a background music file, the final audio with music will be saved as output_with_music.wav.
Functionality
Generate speech using Tortoise TTS model (Fast preset)
Select from male or female voices: 'daniel' or 'angie'
Save generated audio to a file
Optional: Add background music to the output audio

Notes
Ensure you have the soundfile library installed and its dependencies are met.
If you encounter any issues with audio processing, you may need to adjust the paths for FFmpeg's ffmpeg and ffprobe executables in the script.
